# harshal19306
This is Harshal Dev's (2019306 CSD) submission for Precog Recruitment 


"Task 1 Harshal Summary Precog .pdf" is my task 1 submission aka paper summary for the research paper "How Community Feedback Shapes User Behaviour"

For task 2
i worked with csv instead of json

please view the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zMJiRDfgS23NWsvrK5K21CtZNGjTSoWL?usp=sharing to see my pdf for the task 2 and my findings and my .ipynb file
i've done majority of the work required for the task
please note that due to time constraints and weak internet connectivity ( as im in kanpur visiting my father for the winter break ) , i couldnt do the visualisiing part for some part but i did extract the data ( as it can seen the screenshot and .csv file ive uploaded ) . Please considr that i extracted revelent data and just only converting it into the visually appealing graphics was left for a teensy bit parts



For task3 , i've made a folder by the name task3
explaination 
install pymongo using pip and start mongodatabase daemon and ensure that tags.xml and 1.py should be in the same folder and run the 1.py file and voila you would get your desired results.
Since the XML was very big and it was a little problematic at my end to open the file and do the analysis , hence i wasn't able to do the rest of the parts
But i would have followed the same approach for the rest of the xml files as i did for tag.xml . ( we only have to distinguish on the basis of different-different comments(whatever inside the <>) in the xml files)
